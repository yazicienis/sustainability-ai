            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Project TreeStrike is an innovative, autonomous drone-based reforestation system designed to enhance environmental restoration efforts. The system utilizes advanced drone technology, onboard AI, and high-resolution imaging to identify optimal planting sites and efficiently deploy seed bombs.</p>
            
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Altitude Imaging:</strong> The primary drone captures high-altitude images or LiDAR data to locate the base station and assess the terrain.</li>
                <li><strong>Onboard Analysis:</strong> AI algorithms process the collected data to determine the best planting locations based on terrain suitability.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimized Flight Planning:</strong> The system calculates optimal flight paths that adapt to wind conditions, scheduling flights appropriately (e.g., morning outbound and evening return or nighttime operations).</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Docking & Charging:</strong> Upon return, the drone autonomously docks at the base station to recharge via photovoltaic panels and receive seed bomb resupply.</li>
                <li><strong>Seed Deployment:</strong> A secondary drone, specialized for deploying seed bombs, follows the calculated trajectory to plant seeds in the designated areas.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Technical Enhancements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Charging Mechanism:</strong> Efficient recharging through an automated docking process.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Weather Integration:</strong> Incorporation of local weather data to adjust flight paths and optimize operational timing.</li>
                <li><strong>3D Imaging & RTK GPS Integration:</strong> High-precision mapping with up to 1 cm positional accuracy to construct detailed 3D terrain models.</li>
                <li><strong>Offline Operation:</strong> Pre-downloaded environmental resources ensure reliable functionality even with limited internet connectivity.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Team and Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Project TreeStrike is a collaborative initiative supported by a multidisciplinary team including AI & Machine Learning Engineers, Autonomous Navigation Specialists, Embedded Systems Developers, and Geospatial Analysts. Regular meetings and coordinated efforts ensure smooth progress, while industry partners contribute expert guidance and resources.</p>
            
            <h3>Industry Support and Call for Participation</h3>
            <p>Our project benefits from industry support in RTK GPS technology and sustainable agriculture practices. We welcome passionate individuals to join our team.

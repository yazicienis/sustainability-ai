      SustAInability at the SRH Symposium “Sustainable Development”
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview of the Symposium</h2>
      <p>
        The symposium “Sustainable Development @ SRH” brought together lecturers, researchers, students,
        and external partners from different SRH locations to discuss how universities can contribute to
        climate action, social responsibility, and long-term sustainable development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event focused on practical examples from teaching and research, with contributions on climate
        adaptation, digital transformation, community engagement, and interdisciplinary project formats.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Contribution: SustAInability Session</h2>
      <p>
        Within this symposium, our international project
        <strong>“SustAInability AI – A Cross-Cultural Partnership for Improving Education and Environmental Management”</strong>
        was represented in a dedicated session on AI-driven environmental management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The session introduced the SustAInability project as a collaboration between SRH University Heidelberg,
        the University of Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan), and Paragon International University (Cambodia). The focus
        lies on using artificial intelligence and data-driven methods to better understand and address local
        climate and environmental challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contribution was structured around three main aspects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Project vision and partnerships:</strong> Why AI-based approaches are relevant for sustainability and how the project builds a network between Germany, Kyrgyzstan, and Cambodia.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical prototypes:</strong> First concepts and pilot work with IoT sensor systems, environmental data collection, and data analytics for climate-relevant indicators.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational impact:</strong> New teaching formats, student projects, workshops, and study visits that link engineering, AI, and sustainability education.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Presentation by Exchange Student Aisha Toichieva</h2>

    <p class="caption">Aisha Toichieva presenting the SustAInability project at the SRH Symposium.</p>
    </div>
      
      <p>
        The session presentation was delivered by <strong>Aisha Toichieva</strong>, an exchange student from the
        University of Central Asia, who stayed in Heidelberg for three months within the SustAInability project.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her talk, Aisha:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduced the international setup of SustAInability and the motivation for focusing on climate and environmental issues.</li>
        <li>Explained how AI techniques and IoT-based data acquisition can help to monitor local environmental conditions in Central Asia and Southeast Asia.</li>
        <li>Described her own work in Heidelberg on environmental sensor data, first analysis workflows, and how these activities are integrated into student learning.</li>
        <li>Highlighted the importance of cross-cultural exchange, interdisciplinary teamwork, and student mobility for developing responsible technology solutions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Through this contribution, Aisha represented both the project consortium and the student perspective,
        showing how international cooperation can directly feed into practical sustainability education.

      <h2>Key Topics from the SustAInability Project</h2>
      <p>
        The presentation and the subsequent discussion at the symposium touched on several core themes of the
        SustAInability project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI-supported environmental monitoring:</strong> Using machine learning for pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and forecasting in environmental data.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-cost IoT sensor networks:</strong> Designing sensor nodes that are affordable and robust enough for deployment in remote regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Student-centred project work:</strong> Involving students in the full pipeline from sensor installation and data collection to analysis and communication of results.</li>
        <li><strong>International and intercultural collaboration:</strong> Joint workshops, online meetings, and study visits connecting Heidelberg with partner universities in Kyrgyzstan and Cambodia.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These elements make SustAInability both a research-oriented and educational initiative, aligned with our
        association’s focus on supporting education and dialogue in Heidelberg and Baden-Württemberg.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Relevance for Our Association</h2>
      <p>
        As an educational non-profit association based in Heidelberg, we see this contribution to the SRH
        symposium as an important step in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strengthening the link between local educational activities and international university partnerships.</li>
        <li>Giving students the opportunity to present their work in a professional academic setting.</li>
        <li>Promoting responsible and sustainability-oriented use of digital technologies and AI.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The SustAInability project and Aisha Toichieva’s presentation both support our statutory goals in the
        fields of education, science, and intercultural dialogue.
      </p>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        Based on this symposium contribution, the project partners plan to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continue joint student projects and exchange visits related to AI and environmental monitoring.</li>
        <li>Develop teaching materials and workshops that can also be used in our local educational activities in Heidelberg.</li>
        <li>Explore further cooperation formats with SRH and other institutions in Baden-Württemberg.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Updates on SustAInability and related activities will be published regularly in the News section of our website.

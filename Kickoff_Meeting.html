During this meeting, we will discuss the formation of working groups and the topics they will address throughout the project. It's a great chance to experience international cultural exchange while learning from experts in environmental sciences and artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>Students will have the opportunity to meet with academics specializing in environmental sciences and AI, and work together to define the roadmap for our project. Guided by mentors, participants will work on specific topics, present their progress in upcoming workshops, and potentially contribute to academic publications.</p>
            <p>The Kick-Off Meeting will also include an introduction session, where all participants will get to know each other, fostering a collaborative and friendly environment for the upcoming activities.</p>

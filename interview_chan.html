            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Puthearath Chan is an urban environmental engineer and discusses his background and expertise 
                in sustainable urban development, particularly in Cambodia, in this interview. He firstly introduced 
                himself, his PhD from Hanyang University on SDG 11 and his work experience with the Global Green 
                Growth Institute (GGGI) and Ministry of Environment (MoE). He emphasized Cambodia's rich history, 
                friendly people, and developing infrastructure, including high-speed roads and multi-purpose coastal 
                economic development. He detailed the country's energy sector, both local sources and imports from 
                neighboring countries and a commitment to clean energy. He also addressed climate change issues 
                along the Mekong River, including floods and droughts and the government's efforts to mitigate 
                these issues. Dr. Puthearath suggested using technology for environmental monitoring and emphasized 
                the importance of sustainable practices in development.

            <h2>Interview</h2>
            
            <h3>Could you firstly introduce yourself?</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Puthearath Chan and I am currently working as a senior sustainability researcher based 
                in the Ministry of Environment and also an adjunct lecturer for environmental engineering at the 
                Paragon International University in Cambodia.<br><br>
                In my past, I worked with General Secretariat for Green Growth (GSGG) and Global Green Growth 
                Institute (GGGI) on Cambodia Green Urban Development Program (GUDP). There the first project I 
                was fully dedicated to green urban development. After that I did my PhD in sustainable urban 
                development at Hanyang University Seoul Campus, South Korea. My research focused on UN sustainable 
                development goal 11 (SDG 11), but also about assessing the Cambodian SDGs. I still support the 
                sustainable city development projects at the Ministry, after coming back from Korea to Cambodia. 
                I also contribute to circular economy and circular entrepreneurship initiatives. At Paragon 
                International University in Cambodia, I teach mostly environmental and sustainability related 
                aspects, such as environmental engineering course, including green building, while climate change 
                mitigation and adaption are important topics.<br><br>
                Overall, I work with intention to evoke in generating new concept or new project connecting the 
                environment with business. It means evoking eco-friendly and sustainable business ideas, 
                particularly circular business or entrepreneurial concept.
            </p>

            <h3>Can you tell me something about the history of your country, your language and the characteristic of residents?</h3>
            <p>
                Cambodia is the oldest country in Southeast Asia and we have the first major civilization history 
                back in the first century, namely Funan Kingdom (50 CE–627). We have our own language, Khmer 
                script, and neighboring countries also adapted our script. Cambodian people are friendly, not only 
                to our Cambodians but also to international citizens or foreigners. We warmly welcome everybody 
                and English is a popular-used language in Cambodia, so it’s easy for foreigners to work and travel 
                in the country, as they can communicate with us. Also, we have a quite diversity society, including 
                cultures and religions. We have a lot of religions in our country, with Buddhism as the national 
                religion, but also accepting and valuing other religions. Therefore, there is no conflict between 
                different religions in Cambodia and everyone lives together in harmony. 
            </p>

            <h3>How would you describe the economy and infrastructure of your country?</h3>
            <p>
                Cambodia’s two largest industries are textiles and tourism. Tourism is a major sector and considered 
                as a key driver of the country’s growth and development. Mostly, it is driven by the historical 
                temples, especially the greatest temple in the world, namely Angkor Wat, which thus is the most 
                attractive one in our country. Moreover, we have beautiful beaches, that are prettier than in many 
                other countries. Tonle Sap Lake is also the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and one of 
                the most diverse and productive ecosystems in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding the infrastructure, the Ministry of Public Work and Transport is responsible for 
                implementing the national policy concerning construction of all public works, including roads, 
                bridges, ports, railways, etc. Even though we have faced some challenges in term of limited 
                financial and technical resources, the government so far made a significant progress. For example, 
                the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway completed and opened to the public in 2022, while the 
                Phnom Penh-Bavet Expressway began its construction in June 2023. This significantly reduces our 
                travel time; if we take normal roads, we spend five to six hours to get from the city center to 
                the beach. But now we have the Expressway, where we can get to the beach or back to city in a 
                shorter time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, our economy has been one of the fastest growing in the world; in 2016 ADB (Asian 
                Development Bank) named Cambodia as Asia’s New Tiger Economy, and in 2024 UN recommended Cambodia 
                to graduate from a least developed country, and the government is committed to become an 
                upper-middle-income country by 2030 and a high income (developed) country in 2050. I think this 
                goal can be achieved, based on the current economy and infrastructure development trend. In 
                general, I would say that I am proud to see progress in the development of Cambodia.
            </p>

            <h3>How would you view the current energy system in Cambodia and how would you assess the sustainability behind it?</h3>
            <p>
                Cambodia's energy system includes local power generation, imports from neighboring countries, 
                and renewable energy. In the governance system, we have two main ministries overseeing and 
                sustaining the energy sector. Firstly, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) takes the lead in 
                developing government policies/strategies and technical standards for the energy sector. Secondly, 
                the Ministry of Environment (MoE) takes the lead of the National Council for Sustainable 
                Development in promoting renewable (sustainable) energy. Also, MoE is the authority to review 
                and approve the environmental assessments and environmental management plans for all energy 
                projects. The sustainability behind it involves the implementation of the environmental code, 
                which is regulated with a strong commitment to the sustainable development of the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, we are not only producing electricity power domestically, but also importing from 
                Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. Actually, if you want to be independent in the energy sector in the 
                short term, we could invest in the construction of hydropower dams, since our country has a very 
                high potential, especially along the Mekong River and mountain ranges. But the government set a 
                clear direction to sustainable development, and not to construct the hydropower dams, especially 
                in the Mekong River, and already declared it at the COP28 of the United Nations Framework 
                Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Dubai. This is the government’s strong commitment toward 
                sustainability, and promoting clean and renewable energy and decided to continue importing it 
                from our neighbor countries, but the dam is not supposed to be built in the Mekong River.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we look at the daily use, to be honest in the last five years in the dry season, there was 
                not enough electricity supply, but this year we had no lack of supply even could not cover the 
                whole country’s demand, such as islands. The islands are commonly disconnected from the main grid, 
                but the government aims to use solar energy instead of connecting to the main grid. However, the 
                cities on the main land, which are connected to the main grid, are moreover promoting solar energy 
                and energy-efficient use, supported by the Ministry of Environment. While the Ministry of Mines 
                and Energy is responsible for the policy level, the EDC (Electricite du Cambodge) is the supplier 
                in Cambodia (a state-owned public company) and the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) is an 
                autonomous government agency responsible for managing and administering the provision of electric 
                power in Cambodia.
            </p>

            <h3>Considering that the Mekong River flows through Cambodia, do you believe climate change and pollution significantly impact this region?</h3>
            <p>
                This is complicated, so some local issues are sensitive to climate change, but some issues are 
                not; and the impacts of climate change on the Mekong region are various and different from 
                country to country, as the river flows through multiple countries, including China. For Cambodia, 
                as I mentioned earlier, we do not prioritize hydropower dam construction in the Mekong River, 
                and the government also confirmed its decision internationally, especially at COP28, so our 
                Mekong River is quite well in term of water flow and fish migration (no berries), as well as 
                ecosystem and biodiversity conservation. However, climate change still has impacts on our Mekong 
                provinces, such as droughts and floods. Also, I just heard about the recent speech of the Senate 
                President, Samdech Hun Sen, former Prime Minister, regarding flood issues in Cambodia that 
                “Vietnam has prospered in terms of electricity supply by constructing numerous dams. During late 
                July and early August, when floods threaten their harvests, Vietnam strategically closes dams to 
                safeguard their rice and crops, causing floods in Cambodian provinces bordering Vietnam, notably 
                in Kandal, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, Takeo, and Kampot”.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this regard, the government’s under construction Funan Techno Canal, a new canal which 
                connects the Cambodian Mekong River system with the sea, will help our country to reduce floods 
                during the rainy season.
            </p>

            <h3>Do you have some thoughts or ideas on our SustAInability project?</h3>
            <p>
                Before the Kickoff-Meeting for all participants, I saw that the project is between 3 universities 
                and gives the opportunity for students to explore this whole new topic, which I find very 
                interesting and important.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually, I have a lot of ideas for the AI project, but not sure whether they are suitable (size) 
                for our AI project or not. Some of these ideas for environmental management in Cambodia may have 
                already told by Dr. Daniiar Satybaldiev, our project coordinator in Cambodia. Before directly 
                answering your question, I am happy to inform you that using AI or technology for environmental 
                management in Cambodia is strongly recommended by the government. H.E. Minister of Environment 
                has recently used technology widely to protect and manage the environment and natural protected 
                areas. He is quite familiar with technology, as he had relative experience with using and testing 
                it before. For example, he used satellites to manage the protected areas so that illegal logging 
                can be stopped on time, with detailed investigations are done by sub-national authorities, which 
                means the satellite information can be passed to the province. Also, considering the wastewater 
                treatment I can see much improvement in term of using technology. For example, with the support 
                from the Chinese government/companies and others, Ministry could install wastewater monitoring 
                machines at the industrial companies, and when the wastewater of those companies were not well 
                treated, the machines are alert and directly send information to the Ministry; so this technology 
                allows the ministry to monitor the industrial wastewater treatment and ensure the water is 
                cleaned or safe before releasing or discharging to the river. This is quite important as there 
                are so many companies and the government has limited staff. Also, the monitoring of air quality 
                is now more developed. Cambodia is equipped air quality monitoring meters in 25 provinces to 
                monitor air quality and produce data daily. The ministry has also developed air quality index, 
                and the quality is measured much improved due to the new and modern monitoring meters supported 
                by partner countries, such as China and South Korea.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, we see a significant progress of using AI or technologies in environmental and natural 
                resources management towards achieving sustainability in Cambodia as explained above. Though, 
                we still see a lot of opportunities or gap to use AI or (computer) technologies to promote 
                sustainability in Cambodia. In my opinion and based on Pentagonal Strategy’s sustainability and 
                green economy priorities, the following should be the potential areas of applying AI/technology:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Green Economy &amp; Climate Change Mitigation—Green Buildings, Eco-friendly Transport, 
                    Green Industry, Renewable Energy, Waste Management, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Disaster Management and Climate Change Adaptation—Alerting System management, Warning 
                    System development, Prevention/adaptation facility management, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sustainable Cities and Urbanization Management—Using AI/technology as an assessment tool 
                    for the national government (Ministry of Environment/DGE) to monitor and guide/assess the 
                    progress of cities and urbanized areas towards environmentally sustainable cities and 
                    urban development.
                </li>
            </ul>

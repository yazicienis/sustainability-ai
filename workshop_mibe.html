      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The AI and Sustainability workshop brought together MIBE students at SRH Heidelberg to explore how
        artificial intelligence can be used to design realistic, regulation-ready sustainability solutions for
        businesses in Germany and the EU. The event was organized within the MIBE startup project
        <em>“Build Your Own Business in Germany”</em> and concluded with a Certificate of Attendance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Date: 7 November 2025 · Location: Blue Tower, SRH Hochschule Heidelberg · Format: full-day, hands-on workshop.

      <h3>Workshop Team</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Academic Lead &amp; Host:</strong> Prof. Dr. Enis Yazici</li>
        <li><strong>Workshop Design &amp; Facilitation:</strong> Aisha Toichieva (Exchange Student, MIBE)</li>
        <li><strong>Co-Facilitation &amp; Coordination:</strong> Sai Sujit Ghalsasi (Student Assistant, MIBE)</li>
        <li><strong>Program Coordination:</strong> J. Enrique Rumiche (Head of Studies, MIBE)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        The workshop is part of the extra-curricular series in the MIBE program. It does not carry ECTS credits,
        but it supports the startup project module and prepares students for AI-enabled business practice.

      <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
      <p>Participants worked towards the following goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand typical AI architectures used in sustainability applications (text, vision, time series).</li>
        <li>Identify free and open-source tools for environmental data, analytics and reporting.</li>
        <li>Relate AI use cases to EU AI Act, CSRD and ESRS requirements.</li>
        <li>Design an AI-supported sustainability solution with a clear implementation roadmap.</li>
        <li>Communicate their concept in a concise, management-oriented pitch.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Program Highlights</h3>

      <h4>1. AI Architectures, Tools and Sustainability Use Cases</h4>
      <p>
        Aisha introduced core AI building blocks—transformer models for ESG text analysis, computer vision for
        satellite and sensor images, and forecasting models for energy and resource planning. The session focused on
        free tools such as Python notebooks, open datasets, and open-source libraries that students can reuse in
        their MIBE startup projects.
      </p>

      <h4>2. EU Regulation and Strategic Design</h4>
      <p>
        In the second block, students mapped AI applications to EU AI Act risk levels and CSRD/ESRS reporting needs.
        They looked at six typical AI roles in sustainability: monitoring, forecasting, process optimisation,
        supply-chain transparency, compliance reporting, and circular-economy optimisation.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Hands-On Group Work</h4>
      <p>
        Working in teams of 6–8, participants selected a concrete sustainability challenge (e.g. energy, mobility,
        manufacturing, agriculture) and developed an AI-based solution concept. Each team prepared a short
        implementation plan covering data sources, model choices, business value, risks, and regulatory aspects.
      </p>

      <h4>4. How to Talk to AI Agents – Effective Prompting</h4>
      <p>
        In a compact session led by Prof. Enis Yazici, students learned practical techniques for interacting with AI
        agents: structuring prompts, defining roles and constraints, iterating with feedback, and turning vague
        sustainability questions into precise, testable tasks. The focus was on reliable workflows that students can
        reuse in their own projects and in industry settings.
      </p>

      <h4>5. Team Presentations and Feedback</h4>
      <p>
        The workshop closed with short pitches in which teams presented their AI-driven sustainability concepts.
        Feedback centred on innovation, feasibility, user and market understanding, and regulatory awareness—aligned
        with the evaluation criteria of the broader MIBE startup project.

      <h3>Connection to the MIBE Startup Project</h3>
      <p>
        The workshop supports the 8-week MIBE startup project by providing an AI layer on top of the existing
        marketing, entrepreneurship, controlling and research modules. Outcomes can be directly incorporated into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Value Proposition Canvas and Business Model Canvas.</li>
        <li>Market and user-research sections of the startup concept.</li>
        <li>Research questions and hypotheses related to AI-enabled solutions.</li>
        <li>Final pitch presentations and prototype roadmaps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Participants who completed the workshop received a certificate confirming their competencies in AI-supported
        sustainability strategy design.

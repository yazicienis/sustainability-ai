      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This intensive workshop connected AI strategy with real-world sustainability challenges in business.
        MIBE students worked in teams to design AI-driven sustainability solutions using only free and
        open-source tools, with a strong focus on practical implementation and EU regulatory alignment.

      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <p>By the end of the workshop, participants were expected to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand core AI architectures used in sustainability applications (transformers, CNNs, time-series models, reinforcement learning).</li>
        <li>Identify free and open-source tools for data analysis, environmental monitoring, and reporting.</li>
        <li>Map AI use cases to EU AI Act risk categories and CSRD/ESRS sustainability reporting requirements.</li>
        <li>Design an implementation roadmap for an AI-driven sustainability solution, including technical, business, and regulatory aspects.</li>
        <li>Pitch their concept in a concise, management-ready format.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop-structure">
      <h2>Workshop Structure</h2>

      <h3>Hour 1 — AI Architectures &amp; Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Aisha introduced key AI architectures and how they can be applied in sustainability contexts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transformer models</strong> (BERT/GPT) for analysing ESG reports, supplier documents and compliance text at scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer vision</strong> (CNNs) for satellite imagery, waste detection, thermal imaging and environmental monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-series forecasting</strong> (e.g. Prophet, LSTM) for energy demand prediction, maintenance planning and resource optimisation.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong> for dynamic energy management and process control.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The session highlighted the role of Python as a free AI ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn,
        TensorFlow, PyTorch, Prophet, XGBoost) and introduced platforms such as Copernicus Climate Data Store,
        Google Earth Engine, OpenLCA, Climate TRACE, Jupyter Notebooks and open-source BI tools.
      </p>

      <h3>Hour 2 — EU Compliance &amp; Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        The second block focused on the EU AI Act, CSRD and ESRS standards. Participants classified typical
        sustainability AI systems by risk level and discussed data governance and documentation requirements.
        Six strategic AI application categories were introduced:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Monitoring &amp; detection (emissions, leaks, real-time compliance).</li>
        <li>Predictive analytics &amp; modelling (demand, climate risk, supply chains).</li>
        <li>Resource &amp; process optimisation (energy, water, manufacturing).</li>
        <li>Supply chain transparency (Scope&nbsp;3 emissions, due diligence, traceability).</li>
        <li>Compliance reporting automation (CSRD/ESRS dashboards, KPI tracking).</li>
        <li>Sustainable material discovery and circular economy use cases.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Hour 3 — Team Implementation Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Students formed cross-functional teams around sectors such as energy, manufacturing, agriculture,
        transportation and the built environment. Each team selected one concrete sustainability challenge and
        designed an AI solution using only the free tools presented in the first part.
      </p>
      <p>The implementation roadmap template included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Problem definition and stakeholder context.</li>
        <li>Technical solution design (data, models, architecture, open-source stack).</li>
        <li>Business case and ROI estimation.</li>
        <li>Three-phase implementation plan with milestones.</li>
        <li>Risk analysis, mitigation measures and EU compliance mapping.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hour 4 — Presentations &amp; Strategic Discussion</h3>
      <p>
        Teams presented their AI-driven sustainability roadmaps and received feedback based on technical
        feasibility, business logic, completeness, risk awareness and regulatory fit. The session ended with a
        strategic discussion on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build vs. buy decisions for AI and sustainability platforms.</li>
        <li>Data governance and organisational change management.</li>
        <li>How to communicate impact to management using KPIs and clear narratives.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop-outcomes">
      <h2>Outcomes for Students</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Concrete AI &amp; sustainability use cases that can be integrated into their MIBE startup projects.</li>
        <li>Hands-on experience with open-source data, climate and analytics platforms.</li>
        <li>A structured roadmap template for AI implementations in companies.</li>
        <li>Improved presentation and pitching skills in an interdisciplinary setting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Participants who completed the full workshop received a
        <strong>Certificate of Attendance: AI and Sustainability</strong>, signed by the Head of Studies
        and the instructor.

      <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
<p>
  This second online workshop in the <strong>SustAInability</strong> series brings together participants from
  environmental sciences, geography and GIS, water and climate-related studies, urban and regional planning,
  electrical and computer engineering, and IT/AI. The focus is on concrete applications of artificial intelligence
  for environmental monitoring, analysis of climate and land-use data, sensor networks and remote sensing, and
  sustainable management of water and other resources in urban and rural systems.
</p>
<p>
  Over two mornings, students, lecturers, and practitioners will share short presentations, case studies, and
  demonstrations showing how AI tools can support decision-making in environmental and urban contexts, as well as
  in STEM and sustainability education.
</p>

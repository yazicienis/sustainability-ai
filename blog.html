            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Katharina Krohm</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Prof. Dr. Thomas Sterr</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Doctor Thomas Sterr studied PhD economics and did his masters in geography. He was graduated teaching assistant at the South Asia Institute of the University of Heidelberg from 1993 to 1996. Over the years he was managing director and project leader for different projects and moreover scientific director at the Institut für Umweltwirtschaftsanalysen Heidelberg e.V. and part of DCAD, INSPIRE and lecturer at different universities. Since 2017, he works at the SRH university and is head of the studies Climate Change Management and Engineering. This special course was implemented in 2020 and is working on the combination of natural sciences and economy.</p>

            <blockquote>“We try to match economic questions, with social questions and environmental questions. This combination is absolutely necessary, if we want to tackle climate change issues in a comprehensive way.” – Thomas Sterr</blockquote>

            <h3>Q: What does sustainability mean to you on a personal level?</h3>
            <p>Oh, personal level… I could go for the official definition of sustainability but for myself it means that I have to behave in a way that does allow to be in line with the needs of my people that work with me, not only on a regional or local level, but on a global level. And it also means that I care about future needs of future generations...</p>

            <h3>Q: In your opinion, how can sustainability be made more accessible and relevant to the public?</h3>
            <p>That´s a complex question. The key is education. What is really relevant with education is, that I do not only educate or teach people who study CCME (Climate Change Management and Engineering), because they are already convinced...</p>

            <h3>Q: What do you think about current trends, such as circular economy?</h3>
            <p>What we know from nature is that it works in cycles, so every waste of one subject might get food for another subject...</p>

            <h3>Q: How can we connect the trend of zero waste to the circular economy?</h3>
            <p>Zero waste is very much related to circular economy. I should go for zero waste but I should keep in mind that recycling is also resource consuming...</p>

            <h3>Q: In what way would you combine the matter of energy transmission and climate change?</h3>
            <p>Energy transition is very much related to climate change, because we have to think about: What are the reasons for climate change?...</p>

            <h3>Q: How do you view Germany's decision to abandon nuclear power plants in both terms of global warming and human safety?</h3>
            <p>The usage of atomic power doesn't affect our global warming potential, as it is more or less carbon neutral...</p>

            <h3>Q: How would you assess Germany's progress in developing sustainable systems and renewable energy?</h3>
            <p>In Germany, we have, I'd say the advantage, that we do not possess so much oil and gas as the US has...</p>

            <h3>Q: How would you compare Germany´s sustainability efforts to those of China and the USA?</h3>
            <p>I have a European perspective, so I'm proud of the European approaches if I compare them with the Chinese and the American ones...</p>

            <h3>Q: Could you share your thoughts on the SustAInability project, which combines sustainability challenges with artificial intelligence?</h3>
            <p>I still do not know so much about the project, but it's a project related to a lot of unsolved questions...</p>

            <h3>Q: Could you provide some examples of how AI can be used to process data and generate new solutions in sustainability?</h3>
            <p>My spontaneous is a bit offside from climate change but about food waste; For instance, if you have a bakery and you don't sell your products today or tomorrow, it goes to waste...</p>

            <h3>Q: As you have a lot of experience in Asia, does AI have a larger role or impact in countries like China?</h3>
            <p>For China AI is very important because by AI China might also be able to compensate time of experience based learning...</p>

            <h3>Q: Do you think artificial intelligence has potential in addressing climate change issues? If so, in what ways can we use artificial intelligence?</h3>
            <p>We can use artificial intelligence to get a more clear picture about our future energy needs...</p>

            <h3>Q: What are the opportunities and challenges of using AI in climate change and have you already worked with AI?</h3>
            <p>To be honest, I did not ever work with artificial intelligence. But I believe in efficiency gains...</p>

            <h3>Q: Reflecting on past projects; Do you think they would have been easier by using artificial intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Yes, absolutely. When I think, for instance about the project I was coordinating in Central Asia...</p>
